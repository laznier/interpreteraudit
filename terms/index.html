                    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 05, 2025</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Engagement ("Terms") govern your use of the services provided by
                        <strong>Interpreter Audit</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"), including post-hearing transcript
                        audits, expert declarations, and related interpreting services. By engaging our services,
                        you agree to these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. The Parties</h3>
                    <p>
                        This agreement is between <strong>Interpreter Audit</strong> and you
                        (the "Client"), which may include individual attorneys, law firms, non-profit organizations,
                        or other entities retaining our services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Services and Scope of Work</h3>
                    <p>We provide federally certified Russian court interpreter services, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Post-hearing transcript audits and expert declarations</li>
                        <li>Live courtroom interpreting</li>
                        <li>Real-time monitoring of interpreted proceedings</li>
                        <li>Deposition and consultation interpretation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The specific scope for a given matter—including type of service (e.g., post-hearing review),
                        delivery method (in-person, remote), anticipated hours, deadlines, and any equipment or
                        platform requirements—will be set out in a separate engagement letter, email, or written
                        agreement for each project. That scope description is incorporated into these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Independent Contractor</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are engaged as an independent contractor. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership,
                        joint venture, or employment relationship. We are responsible for our own taxes, insurance,
                        and professional obligations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p>
                        We shall maintain the confidentiality of all information provided by you, including case
                        details, audio recordings, transcripts, and any sensitive legal documents. We adhere to
                        applicable professional codes of conduct for interpreters and will not disclose information
                        without your consent, except as required by law or court order.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Qualifications</h3>
                    <p>
                        We hold federal certification as a Russian court interpreter and maintain relevant experience
                        in immigration, federal, and related proceedings. You are encouraged to request current
                        certification details or curriculum vitae as needed for your records or court filings.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. Payment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fees for services will be agreed upon in advance, typically in writing (e.g., engagement
                        letter, email confirmation). A deposit or retainer may be required for certain matters.
                        Invoices are generally issued upon completion of services or at agreed milestones, and
                        payment is due within 30 days unless otherwise specified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Late payments may incur reasonable late fees or interest to cover administrative costs.
                        We reserve the right to pause work or decline new assignments where invoices are seriously
                        overdue.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. Modification</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any changes to these Terms must be in writing and agreed by both parties. Updates to general
                        site terms published on <strong>interpreteraudit.com</strong> will apply prospectively; they
                        do not retroactively alter the terms of a prior written engagement for completed work unless
                        expressly agreed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8. Termination</h3>
                    <p>
                        Either party may terminate an engagement with reasonable written notice. Upon termination,
                        you agree to pay for all work completed and reasonable non-refundable commitments (such as
                        reserved hearing dates) made in reliance on the engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon request, we will return or securely delete client materials, subject to any legal or
                        professional obligations regarding record retention.
                    </p>

                    <h3>9. Force Majeure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neither party is liable for delays or failures in performance caused by events beyond their
                        reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, public emergencies,
                        technical outages, or serious illness. In such circumstances, both parties will make
                        reasonable efforts to reschedule or adjust deliverables.
                    </p>

                    <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of [Your State], without regard to its
                        conflict-of-law principles. You may update this clause to specify the jurisdiction where
                        your practice is based.
                    </p>

                    <h3>11. Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our total liability arising out of or related to the services provided under these Terms
                        is limited to the aggregate fees paid for those specific services. To the maximum extent
                        permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive
                        damages, including lost profits or lost opportunities, even if advised of the possibility
                        of such damages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By engaging our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
                        these Terms of Engagement.
