                    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 05, 2025</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Engagement ("Terms") govern your use of the services provided by
                        <strong>Interpreter Audit</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"), including post-hearing transcript
                        audits, expert declarations, and related interpreting services. By engaging our services,
                        you agree to these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. The Parties</h3>
                    <p>
                        This agreement is between <strong>Interpreter Audit</strong> and you
                        (the "Client"), which may include individual attorneys, law firms, non-profit organizations,
                        or other entities retaining our services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Services and Scope of Work</h3>
                    <p>We provide federally certified Russian interpreter services, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Post-hearing transcript audits and expert declarations</li>
                        <li>Live courtroom interpreting</li>
                        <li>Real-time monitoring of interpreted proceedings</li>
                        <li>Deposition and consultation interpretation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The specific scope for a given matter—including type of service (e.g., post-hearing review),
                        delivery method (in-person, remote), anticipated hours, deadlines, and any equipment or
                        platform requirements—will be set out in a separate engagement letter, email, or written
                        agreement for each project. That scope description is incorporated into these Terms.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. No Legal Advice</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our services support attorneys and legal teams, but we do not provide legal advice and
                        do not represent clients in any legal capacity. All legal strategy, filings, and
                        decisions remain the sole responsibility of the attorney or law firm. Nothing in our
                        reports, audits, or communications should be construed as legal advice.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Independent Contractor</h3>
                    <p>
                        We provide services as an independent contractor. Nothing in these Terms creates a
                        partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between Interpreter Audit and
                        the Client or the Client’s firm. We are responsible for our own taxes, insurance,
                        and professional obligations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p>
                        We shall maintain the confidentiality of all information provided by you, including case
                        details, audio recordings, transcripts, and any sensitive legal documents. We adhere to
                        applicable professional codes of conduct for interpreters and will not disclose information
                        without your consent, except as required by law or court order.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. Client Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for providing complete and accurate materials necessary for the
                        engagement, including recordings, transcripts, pleadings, and scheduling details,
                        within reasonable timeframes. We are not responsible for delays, omissions, or
                        limitations in our work product caused by incomplete, inaccurate, or late materials,
                        or by technical issues outside of our control.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. Qualifications</h3>
                    <p>
                        We hold federal certification as a Russian interpreter and maintain relevant experience
                        in immigration, federal, and related proceedings. Where required by local rules or agencies,
                        we also maintain additional state or court-specific registrations or approvals. You are
                        encouraged to request current certification details or curriculum vitae as needed for your
                        records or court filings.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8. Payment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fees for services will be agreed upon in advance, typically in writing (e.g., engagement
                        letter, email confirmation). A deposit or retainer may be required for certain matters.
                        Invoices are generally issued upon completion of services or at agreed milestones, and
                        payment is due within 30 days unless otherwise specified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Late payments may incur reasonable late fees or interest to cover administrative costs.
                        We reserve the right to pause work or decline new assignments where invoices are seriously
                        overdue.
                    </p>

                    <h3>9. Modification</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any changes to these Terms must be in writing and agreed by both parties. Updates to general
                        site terms published on <strong>interpreteraudit.com</strong> will apply prospectively; they
                        do not retroactively alter the terms of a prior written engagement for completed work unless
                        expressly agreed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>10. Termination</h3>
                    <p>
                        Either party may terminate an engagement with reasonable written notice. Upon termination,
                        you agree to pay for all work completed and any reasonable non-refundable commitments (such as
                        reserved hearing dates, blocked time, or travel arrangements) made in reliance on the engagement,
                        in accordance with the cancellation and no-show terms stated in our engagement email or letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon request, we will return or securely delete client materials, subject to any legal or
                        professional obligations regarding record retention.
                    </p>

                    <h3>11. Force Majeure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neither party is liable for delays or failures in performance caused by events beyond their
                        reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, public emergencies,
                        technical outages, or serious illness. In such circumstances, both parties will make
                        reasonable efforts to reschedule or adjust deliverables.
                    </p>

                    <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its
                        conflict-of-law principles, unless otherwise required by mandatory law in the jurisdiction
                        where the services are performed. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms
                        shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Florida, and both parties
                        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
                    </p>

                    <h3>13. No Guarantee of Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our audits, declarations, and interpreting services are professional opinions based
                        on the materials and information provided. Because court and agency decisions depend
                        on many factors beyond our control, we do not and cannot guarantee any particular
                        result in litigation, appeals, or administrative proceedings.
                    </p>

                    <h3>14. Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our total liability arising out of or related to the services provided under these Terms
                        is limited to the aggregate fees paid for those specific services. To the maximum extent
                        permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive
                        damages, including lost profits or lost opportunities, even if advised of the possibility
                        of such damages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By engaging our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
                        these Terms of Engagement.
