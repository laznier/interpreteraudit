                    <h3>2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you

                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a
                        valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With your consent.</li>

                        <li>To protect your vital interests or those of another person.</li>
                        <li>To pursue our legitimate business interests in a manner that does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. When And With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the
                        following third parties:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cloud storage providers for receiving and storing file uploads.</li>
                        <li>Email service providers for sending notifications and correspondence.</li>
                        <li>
                            Professional advisors (such as legal or IT security consultants) where reasonably
                            necessary to support our services.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We require third parties to keep personal information confidential and secure and to use
                        it only for the purposes we specify.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
                        privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal
                        information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
                        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                        accounting, or other legal requirements).
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
                        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use of encryption or secure portals for sensitive file uploads where appropriate.</li>
                        <li>Restricted access to case materials and stored files.</li>
                        <li>Reasonable retention and deletion practices for case records.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
                        transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
                        100% secure. You should only transmit sensitive information through channels you are
                        comfortable with and that we have confirmed as appropriate for your case.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you may have rights that allow you
                        greater access to and control over your personal information. These may include the right
                        to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Request access to personal information we hold about you.</li>
                        <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
                        <li>Request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal and ethical obligations.</li>
                        <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To exercise any of these rights, you may contact us at
                        <a href="mailto:cases@interpreteraudit.com">cases@interpreteraudit.com</a>. We will
                        consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8. Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                        Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
                        not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
                        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                        been finalized; therefore, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                    </p>
